# KitPvP

## What is this?
Welcome to the official source code of AvengeTech's (dead) gamemode, ArcadePvP. Everything that happened on the KitPvP server can be found here.

## Why is this open to everyone?
We've decided to open up our source code for the world to see, because our gamemode wasn't simply put, not going anywhere. Maybe we can help you with your server, using the resources in this code.

## Can't I just put this on my server and make it my own?
You _could_, but it'd take lots of editing, since this plugin depends on the server's Main Core, which will **not** be released to the public.

## Other Information
Credit anywhere is highly appreciated, but **not required**. I'd love some credit for the hard work I've put into this over the past year and a half, but it's your choice.

Thank you to the players and community that motivated me to bring this gamemode to life. It was the start of AvengeTech v2 and we wouldn't be where we are without the players that stuck around through our hard times.
